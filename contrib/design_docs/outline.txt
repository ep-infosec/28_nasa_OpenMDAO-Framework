Should cover the steps necessary to prepare for execution ("setup stack") internally:

- use example problem to illustrate concepts (better then sellar?)


Build depgraph?
    -setup time vs. live changes per connection
    -gives code simplification vs old way of doing things

Assembly lifecycle?
    -checkconfig will happen after setup, following refactor

Collapse depgraph
    -at beginning of setup

Create subgraphs for each driver


Do system decomposition
    - Error checking

execution management (data passing, etc)
    -scattering: primary data passing mechanism for flattened data

Flattenable vs non-flattenable variables 
    -impact on differentiation

distinguish linear solvers available for derivatives
    -ksp, gmres, linear gauss-seidel


Case recording structure

Implicit vs explicit components & their dynamics
    -

relationship between an assembly any subassembly

Systems dictionary:
    -serial
    -parallel
    -simple
    -compound
    -opaque

Python class hierarchy

Distrbuted vectors: U, P, F

Non differentiable finite difference grouping.
