       INPUT file structure for AXOD code:

The  total input file is made of data from several stages for a given case.
Each case is started with 2 Title lines, followed by a namelist "DATAIN'.
Each namelist contain data for a stage within the case.

A file can have as many cases as desired.


INPUT file outline:

                   Title1   line
                   Title2   line
&DATAIN              (.......start of namelist DATAIN ... Stage1 )
         var1 = value,
         var2 = value,
                 .
                 .                 more variables
                 .
/                  (end of namelist)
&DATAIN              (.......start of namelist DATAIN ..  next stage   'Stage2')
         var1 = value
         var2 = value
                 .
                 .                 more variables
                 .
/                  (end of namelist)

                 .
                 .                 more stages
                 .




Note:  a variable cane be assigned as  'Case1.Stage1.var1 = val'
           or                          'Case1.Stage2.var1 = val'
  
       This is an example when component code is used to define variables.
