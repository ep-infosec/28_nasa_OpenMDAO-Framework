This directory is intended to contain source to be packaged into 
python distributions that are releasable separately from OpenMDAO.  These
distributions may or may not depend upon OpenMDAO.  Distributions that have 
not yet been approved to be part of openmdao.lib can live here, as long as 
they are license compatible with NOSA, i.e., no GPL or proprietary code 
should be placed here.
